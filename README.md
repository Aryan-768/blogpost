# blogpost
Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a simple, clean blog web application where users (or the site owner) can write, publish, edit and delete blog posts in an intuitive interface. It solves the common need of having a lightweight blog platform without heavy overhead, enabling quick content creation and management.

Key requirements:

Create and publish blog posts easily.

Edit existing posts.

Delete posts when needed.

Provide an aesthetic and responsive frontend.

Use a modern tech stack for both frontend and build process.

Tech Stack Used

Frontend: Built using modern web tooling (based on project files such as package.json, tailwind.config.js, vite.config.mjs).

CSS framework: Tailwind CSS (via tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js).

Build tool / bundler: Vite (via vite.config.mjs).

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The markup and script foundation (there is index.html present).

Deployed link:-

Static site or client-only app: The presence of dist, public, src folders suggests a build-then-deploy model (e.g., static hosting or front-end hosted).

Environment configuration: .env file present for configuring environment variables.
